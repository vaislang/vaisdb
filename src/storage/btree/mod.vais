# B+Tree Index Module
# Balanced tree index for efficient point lookups and range scans
# Based on Stage 1 Section 9 and Stage 4

# Submodules (auto-discovered by filesystem)
# entry             — Entry types (internal 8B, leaf 8B) and key comparison
# node              — Internal and leaf node page format
# tree              — B+Tree structure with root tracking
# cursor            — Cursor-based iteration over leaf entries
# key               — Key encoding, composite keys, prefix compression
# search            — Advanced search: lower_bound, upper_bound, range scan
# insert            — Insert with automatic leaf/internal split
# delete            — Delete with underflow detection, merge/redistribute
# split             — Node split operations (leaf and internal)
# merge             — Node merge and redistribution
# wal_integration   — WAL record generation for B+Tree operations
# bulk_load         — Efficient bottom-up B+Tree construction from sorted data
# prefix            — Prefix compression for key storage optimization
# latch             — Optimistic latch crabbing for concurrent access
